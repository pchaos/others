install 

git clone https://github.com/kivy/kivy
cd kivy
make
This should compile kivy, to make it accessible in your python env just point your PYTHONPATH to this dir:

export PYTHONPATH=~/code/kivy:$PYTHONPATH
To check if kivy is installed, type the following command in your terminal:

python -c "import kivy"


以下方式不需要添加PYTHONPATH
Alternatively, if you don’t want to make any changes to Kivy itself, you can also run (as admin, e.g. with sudo):

$ python setup.py install


Running the test suite¶
To help detect issues and behaviour changes in Kivy, a set of unittests are provided. A good thing to do is to run them just after your Kivy installation, and every time you intend to push a change. If you think something was broken in Kivy, perhaps a test will show this. (If not, it might be a good time to write one.)

Kivy tests are based on nosetest, which you can install from your package manager or using pip:

$ pip install nose
To run the test suite, do:

$ make test

# ---------- kivytut.py ----------
 
import kivy
kivy.require('1.9.0')
 
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.button import Label
 
# Inherit Kivy's App class which represents the window
# for our widgets
# HelloKivy inherits all the fields and methods
# from Kivy
class HelloKivy(App):
 
    # This returns the content we want in the window
    def build(self):
 
        # Return a label widget with Hello Kivy
        return Label(text="Hello Kivy")
 
helloKivy = HelloKivy()
helloKivy.run()
 
# ---------- kivytut2.py ----------
 
import kivy
kivy.require('1.9.0')
 
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.button import Label
 
# Inherit Kivy's App class which represents the window
# for our widgets
# HelloKivy inherits all the fields and methods
# from Kivy
class HelloKivyApp(App):
 
    # This returns the content we want in the window
    def build(self):
 
        # Return a label widget with Hello Kivy
        # The name of the kv file has to be hellokivy
        # minus the app part from this class to
        # match up properly
        return Label()
 
hello_kivy = HelloKivyApp()
hello_kivy.run()
 
# ---------- hellokivy.kv ----------
 
# We can separate the logic from the presentation layer
<Label>:
    text: "Hello Kivy"
