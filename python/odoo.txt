Enterprise Edition
If you have access to the Enterprise repository (see Editions if you wish to get access), you can use this command to fetch the addons:

$ git clone https://github.com/odoo/enterprise.git
The Enterprise git repository does not contain the full Odoo source code. It is only a collection of extra add-ons. The main server code is in the Community version. Running the Enterprise version actually means running the server from the Community version with the addons-path option set to the folder with the Enterprise version.

You need to clone both the Community and Enterprise repository to have a working Odoo installation


# 使用代理可以clone，不报错
git clone --depth 1 -b 11.0 --single-branch https://github.com/OCA/OCB.git odoo
git clone --depth 1 -b 11.0 --single-branch https://gitee.com/pchaos/OCB.git odoo

git clone --depth 1 --branch 11.0 https://www.github.com/odoo/enterprise "enterprise/addons"

How can I download and install Odoo 11?
Odoo can be found on Github, you can find Odoo 11 here.
You can find the official downloads (for Windows, Debian, RPM and the sources) at https://www.odoo.com/page/download
To install it on Ubuntu you can follow the following steps:

1. Download my installation script from Github and copy it locally:

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript/11.0/odoo_install.sh
2. Edit the file and modify the parameters that you'd like to change:

sudo nano odoo_install.sh
Tip: If you'd like the enterprise version you should set IS_ENTERPRISE to True instead of false.
3. Make the file executable:

sudo chmod +x odoo_install.sh
4. Execute the script and wait a few minutes for Odoo to install:

./odoo_install.sh
