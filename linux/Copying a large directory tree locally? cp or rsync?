Copying a large directory tree locally? cp or rsync?

https://serverfault.com/questions/43014/copying-a-large-directory-tree-locally-cp-or-rsync

(cd /run/media/yg/2c98a2b5-6e9a-4d85-915d-ff3f3e8f70f6/backup201512/myDocs; tar cf - .) | (cd /home/yg/myDocs; tar xpf -)


Definitely what I always do is use cpio:

find . -print | cpio -pdm /target/folder
This is almost fast than CP, definitely faster than tar and without pipeing anything.
