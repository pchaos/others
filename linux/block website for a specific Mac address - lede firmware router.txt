block website for a specific Mac address - lede firmware router

It is possible using the firewall/iptables rules. The downside is that IP addresses might change and you would have to adopt the iptables configuration.

In the web GUI of Lede, navigate to

Network -> Firewall -> "Traffic Rules"
In the New forward rule section give the new rule a name and verify that

Source zone: lan
Destination zone: wan
which is the default. Then press Add and edit.

Then adopt the settings as follows to your needs.

Source MAC address
Destination address ( the IP address of the site you want to block )
Action: Reject
Finally press Save & Apply.

Another possibility would be to use an adblocker and configure it in a way that the websites you want to block are blocked by the adblocker. The downside is, that this would affect all computers on your network.
If the users can change the DNS server, they can easily configure a different DNS server and bypass this method.
