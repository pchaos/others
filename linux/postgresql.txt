dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib

The database initialization could be done using following command. It creates the configuration files postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf

postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql

# 启动postgresql
The postgresql server is turned off and disabled by default. You can enable its start during the boot using following command:

# sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo systemctl start postgresql

sudo su postgres
psql


> I`m change the default passwod, and not conect for this user. What the 
> default password?

there is no default password.  on most unix and linux distributions, the 
default authentication mode is set to 'ident' which means a given unix 
user X can only connect as the postgres user X.   initially, the only 
postgres user is 'postgres', so...

(assuming you're on the typical unix/linux system, you didn't say)

     $ sudo -u postgres psql

     postgres=> alter user postgres password 'apassword';
     postgres=> create user yerusername createdb createuser password 
'somepass';
     postgres=> create database yerusername owner yerusername;
     postgres=> \q

     $ ...

now as your regular user 'yerusername' you can connect to postgres, and 
have the privileges to create new users and databases.

That sequence also modified the postgres user's password in case you 
change the default authentication method to md5 (this is set in 
pg_hba.conf, see the documentation for more details)

Reset Forgotten Password For postgres User

PostgreSQL uses the  pg_hba.conf configuration file that is stored in the database data directory to control the client authentication. HBA means host-based authentication. To reset the password for the postgres user, you need to modify some parameters in this configuration file.

Step 1. Backup the pg_dba.conf file by copying it to a different location or just rename it to pg_dba_bk.conf

Step 2. Edit the pg_dba.conf file by adding the following line as the first line after the comment lines. The comment line starts with the # sign.

local  all   all   trust
If your PostgreSQL installation does not support local, which indicates UNIX sockets, for example, if you install PostgreSQL on Windows OS. If you use local in this case, you cannot start PostgreSQL service. In this situation, you need to use the following entry in the pg_hba.conf file:

host    all              postgres   	     127.0.0.1/32            trust
This step ensures that you can log into PostgreSQL database server without using the password.

Step 3. Restart PostgreSQL server e.g., in Linux, you use the following command:

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Step 4. Connect to PostgreSQL database server and change the password of the postgres user.

sudo -u postgres psql

ALTER USER postgres with password 'very_secure_password';

Step 5. Restore the pg_db.conf file and restart the server, and connect to the PostgreSQL database server with new password.

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
In this tutorial, we have shown you how to reset the forgotten password of the postgres user.
