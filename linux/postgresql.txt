dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib

The database initialization could be done using following command. It creates the configuration files postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf

postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql

# 启动postgresql
The postgresql server is turned off and disabled by default. You can enable its start during the boot using following command:

# sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo systemctl start postgresql

sudo su postgres
psql

there is no default password.  on most unix and linux distributions, the 
default authentication mode is set to 'ident' which means a given unix 
user X can only connect as the postgres user X.   initially, the only 
postgres user is 'postgres', so...

(assuming you're on the typical unix/linux system, you didn't say)

     $ sudo -u postgres psql

     postgres=> alter user postgres password 'apassword';
     postgres=> create user yerusername createdb createuser password 
'somepass';
     postgres=> create database yerusername owner yerusername;
     postgres=> \q

     $ ...

now as your regular user 'yerusername' you can connect to postgres, and 
have the privileges to create new users and databases.

That sequence also modified the postgres user's password in case you 
change the default authentication method to md5 (this is set in 
pg_hba.conf, see the documentation for more details)
