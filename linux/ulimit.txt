Increase the open files limit on Linux
see all limits, run

ulimit -Sa # soft limits
ulimit -Ha # hard limits

systemd
If you are on a systemd-based system, try editing both /etc/systemd/system.conf and /etc/systemd/user.conf and adding the following line under the [Manager] section (see systemd-system.conf(5)):

DefaultLimitNOFILE=16384

# user.conf
DefaultLimitNOFILE=8192:8192

Then reboot the system.

I found out about this setting from a comment by Ewan Leith, but changing user.conf alone didnâ€™t work for me; 
I had to change both user.conf and system.conf.
