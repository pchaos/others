Remove GUI part of "server with GUI"

yum group remove "Server with GUI"
yum groupremove "GNOME Desktop Environment"
yum groupremove "X Window System"

systemctl set-default multi-user.target
reboot
That will stop the gui from loading on boot and instead give you the text login

To change it back:

systemctl set-default graphical.target
reboot
