How to install VirtualBox Guest Additions in a Debian virtual machine?
Follow these steps to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions on your Linux Debian virtual machine:

Open terminal and become root (su); if you have sudo enabled, you may also do for example sudo -i; see man sudo for all options):

su
enter root password and press enter

alternatively you can use sudo -s if you have it installed and the user where you are logged in has the necessary rights...

Update APT cache:

apt-get update
Install the latest security updates:

This step will upgrade all your packages, so be wise about it. Try the following steps first and they might be enough to work if not, then perform upgrade and retry.

apt-get upgrade
apt full-upgrade
apt install libxrandr2 libxt6 libxmu6
Install these required packages:

Packages build-essential and module-assistant are both required to be able to compile the kernel modules and so when installing the VirtualBox Linux Guest Additions you must have them. So, this command will get the headers and packages (compilers and libraries) required to work. Notice, that after installing your VirtualBox Linux Guest Additions you will leave behind some packages as well as Linux headers, which you might delete afterwards or not. In my case they didn't hurt, but for the sake of system tidiness, you might want to pick up after playing.

apt-get install build-essential module-assistant
Configure your system for building kernel modules:

m-a prepare

Insert Guest Additions ISO:

Expand menu Devices and click on Insert Guest Additions CD image...

It should mount automatically, but if for any reason it doesn't:

mount /media/cdrom
Run the following script:

sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
Restart the system:

reboot
