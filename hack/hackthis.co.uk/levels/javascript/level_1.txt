[HackThis!] JavaScript Level 1
We are now ready to kick off another hacking exploration. The level we examine today is the JavaScript Level 1.

There is no assignment, however, nor are there hints. What can we do? Let us look at the source code to hopefully find out.

This is what we see on line 29:

<script type='text/javascript'>
$(function(){ $('.level-form').submit(function(e){
e.preventDefault();
if(document.getElementById('pass').value == correct){
document.location = '?pass=' + correct;}
else{
alert('Incorrect password')}})})
</script>
It appears to be a password check. What it does is compare the password string to another, stored in the variable “correct”. Next, we Ctrl + F browse for “correct”. At the very end of the page, we see:


<script type='text/javascript'>
var correct = 'jrules'
</script>
There goes our solution.
