Here begins a new adventure on HackThis!, with Crypt Level 1. This is likely going to be an ongoing solution series, as I have not yet completed all of the levels. I look forward to learning more about my readers, if I have any who are smarter than I am with the last few challenges (why some such people would be reading a very basic security blog like mine, of course, is beyond me, but one never knows).

The assignment is:

Decrypt the following text
