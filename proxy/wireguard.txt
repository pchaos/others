Copy whatever that last line is for you and paste it into the box at the top of this page, under "Your wireguard public key:".
Enter your cryptostorm token (or it's SHA512 hash) into the box above that, then click the "ADD KEY" button.
This page will then show you the pre-shared key (PSK) and IP that you will need in your WireGuard configs. Each WireGuard key you generate will have a different PSK/IP.
To generate all of the configs, use the script at https://cryptostorm.is/wg_confgen.txt.
For example, if after entering my cryptostorm token and WireGuard public key, this page gave me the PSK No2ax6F0iFOXjFV2WxpSNXdvgfbP+NSuV/We2R5QGUk= and the IP 10.10.53.129
then I would run the commands:

wget https://cryptostorm.is/wg_confgen.txt -Oconfgen.sh
chmod +x confgen.sh
./confgen.sh No2ax6F0iFOXjFV2WxpSNXdvgfbP+NSuV/We2R5QGUk= 10.10.53.129
